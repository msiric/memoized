# Data Structures & Algorithms Track

Master fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms essential for technical interviews and efficient programming. This comprehensive track covers both built-in JavaScript data structures and custom implementations.

## What You'll Learn

- **Built-in Data Structures**: Arrays, objects, sets, maps, and JavaScript primitives
- **User-defined Data Structures**: Linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, and advanced structures
- **Algorithm Patterns**: Common problem-solving techniques and optimizations
- **Interview Preparation**: Real questions with optimal solutions and explanations

## Track Structure

### 1. Built-in Data Structures (FREE)
Understanding and utilizing JavaScript's native data structures including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, sets, and maps. Learn their concepts, use cases, time and space complexities.

### 2. User-defined Data Structures (PREMIUM - Sample Only)
*This section contains premium content showing advanced data structure implementations.*

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
- Basic programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)
- Understanding of Big O notation (helpful but not required)

## Why This Track Matters

Data structures and algorithms are the foundation of:
- **Technical Interviews**: Most coding interviews focus on these concepts
- **Performance Optimization**: Choosing the right data structure impacts efficiency
- **Problem Solving**: Learning to break down complex problems systematically
- **Software Architecture**: Understanding trade-offs in system design
