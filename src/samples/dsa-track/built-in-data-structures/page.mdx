# Built-in Data Structures

Understanding and utilizing JavaScript's native data structures including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, sets, and maps. Learn their concepts, use cases, time and space complexities, and practical tips and tricks.

## Section Overview

JavaScript provides several built-in data structures that form the foundation of most applications:

- **Strings**: Text manipulation and string algorithms
- **Numbers**: Numerical operations and mathematical computations  
- **Arrays**: Ordered collections with powerful methods
- **Objects**: Key-value pairs and hash table functionality
- **Sets**: Collections of unique values
- **Maps**: Key-value pairs with any type of keys
- **Remaining Primitives**: Boolean, null, undefined, and Symbol

## Why Master Built-ins First?

### Performance Benefits
- Built-in structures are optimized by JavaScript engines
- Understanding their complexity helps choose the right tool
- Avoid reinventing the wheel when built-ins suffice

### Interview Success
- Many interview questions use these structures
- Demonstrating mastery shows fundamental understanding
- Knowledge transfers to any JavaScript environment

### Practical Application
- Most real-world applications rely heavily on these
- Modern frameworks build upon these foundations
- Understanding limitations helps architect better solutions

## Learning Approach

1. **Understand the Structure**: How it works internally
2. **Learn the Methods**: Available operations and their complexity
3. **Practice Applications**: Solve problems using each structure
4. **Compare Trade-offs**: When to use each structure
5. **Optimization Patterns**: Common performance improvements

## Big O Complexity Guide

Understanding time and space complexity for operations:

- **Arrays**: Access O(1), Search O(n), Insert/Delete O(n)
- **Objects**: Access O(1), Search O(n), Insert/Delete O(1)
- **Sets**: Add/Delete/Has O(1) average
- **Maps**: Get/Set/Delete O(1) average

This foundation prepares you for more advanced data structures!
