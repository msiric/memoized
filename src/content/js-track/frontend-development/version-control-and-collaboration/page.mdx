# **Version Control and Collaboration with Git**

Version control is a critical aspect of modern software development, enabling teams to manage changes to source code over time. Git is the most widely used version control system, offering powerful features for tracking code history, branching, merging, and collaboration. This lesson explores Git workflows, branching strategies, and collaboration techniques, including code reviews and pull requests.



## **Introduction to Version Control**

### **What is Version Control?**

- **Definition**:  
  Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

- **Purpose**:
  - **Track History**: Keep a detailed record of code changes.
  - **Collaboration**: Allow multiple developers to work on the same project.
  - **Revert Changes**: Restore previous versions of the code if needed.
  - **Branching**: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.

### **Benefits of Using Git**

- **Distributed System**:  
  Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including history, allowing for offline work and redundancy.

- **Performance**:  
  Local operations are fast since they don't require network access.

- **Branching and Merging**:  
  Git makes it easy to create, merge, and delete branches.

- **Data Integrity**:  
  Git uses a SHA-1 hashing algorithm to ensure data integrity.

- **Flexibility**:  
  Supports various workflows and can be customized to fit team needs.

### **Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control Systems**

- **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**:
  - **Examples**: Subversion (SVN), CVS.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - A single central repository.
    - Developers check out files and commit changes to this central location.
    - Requires network access for most operations.
  - **Limitations**:
    - Single point of failure.
    - Limited offline capabilities.

- **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**:
  - **Examples**: Git, Mercurial.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Each developer has a full copy of the repository.
    - Supports offline work.
    - Better performance for local operations.
  - **Advantages**:
    - No single point of failure.
    - Facilitates branching and merging.
    - Encourages collaboration.

  ```

### **Basic Git Commands**

- **Initialize a Repository**:

  ```bash
  git init
  ```

- **Clone a Repository**:

  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```

- **Check Repository Status**:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

- **Add Changes to Staging Area**:

  ```bash
  git add <file>
  git add .         # Adds all changes in the current directory
  ```

- **Commit Changes**:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Commit message"
  ```

  git diff --staged                  # Changes in staging area
  ```

## **Git Branching and Workflows**

### **Understanding Branches**

- **Branches in Git**:
  - A branch is a movable pointer to a commit.
  - The default branch is usually named `master` or `main`.
  - Branches allow you to isolate work on different features or fixes.

- **Creating and Switching Branches**:

  ```bash
  git branch <branch-name>       # Create a new branch
  git checkout <branch-name>     # Switch to a branch
  git checkout -b <branch-name>  # Create and switch to a new branch
  ```

### **Branching Strategies**

#### **Git Flow**

- **Overview**:
  - A well-defined branching model ideal for projects with scheduled releases.
  - **Main Branches**:
    - `master`: Contains production-ready code.
    - `develop`: Integrates features for the next release.
  - **Supporting Branches**:
    - `feature/*`: For developing new features.
    - `release/*`: For preparing a new production release.
    - `hotfix/*`: For quick patches to production code.

- **Workflow**:
  - **Feature Development**:
    - Branch off from `develop` into `feature/feature-name`.
    - Merge back into `develop` when complete.
  - **Release Preparation**:
    - Branch off from `develop` into `release/version-number`.
    - Perform final testing and fixes.
    - Merge into `master` and tag the release.
  - **Hotfixes**:
    - Branch off from `master` into `hotfix/issue-name`.
    - Merge back into both `master` and `develop`.

#### **GitHub Flow**

- **Overview**:
  - A simpler workflow suitable for continuous deployment and smaller teams.
  - **Key Points**:
    - `master` (or `main`) is always deployable.
    - Create feature branches off `master`.
    - Open a pull request when the feature is ready.
    - Merge back into `master` after approval.

- **Workflow**:
  - **Feature Development**:
    - Branch off from `master` into `feature-name`.
    - Push commits to the remote branch.
    - Open a pull request for review.
  - **Deployment**:
    - Merge the pull request into `master`.
    - Deploy immediately if desired.

#### **Trunk-Based Development**

- **Overview**:
  - Emphasizes continuous integration by having developers commit to a single shared branch (often `master` or `main`).
  - **Key Points**:
    - Short-lived feature branches or direct commits to `master`.
    - Frequent integration to avoid merge conflicts.
    - Suitable for agile environments and continuous delivery.

### **Merging and Rebasing**

#### **Merging**

- **Fast-Forward Merge**:
  - Occurs when the target branch is an ancestor of the source branch.
  - The pointer is simply moved forward.
  - **Command**:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git merge feature-branch
    ```

- **Three-Way Merge**:
  - Used when branches have diverged.
  - Git creates a new merge commit.
  - **Command**:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git merge feature-branch
    ```

#### **Rebasing**

- **Purpose**:
  - Reapply commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.

- **Usage**:

  ```bash
  git checkout feature-branch
  git rebase master
  ```

- **Considerations**:
  - **Pros**:
    - Cleaner, linear history.
    - Easier to follow the project timeline.
  - **Cons**:
    - Rewrites history; avoid rebasing commits that have been pushed to a shared repository.

- **Interactive Rebase**:

  ```bash
  git rebase -i HEAD~n    # Where n is the number of commits to look back
  ```

  - Allows you to edit, reorder, squash, or drop commits.

## **Collaboration with Git**

### **Remote Repositories**

- **Definition**:
  - A remote repository is a version of your project hosted on a network server.
- **Common Operations**:
  - **Add a Remote**:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin <repository-url>
    ```

  - **List Remotes**:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

### **Cloning, Fetching, Pulling, and Pushing**

- **Cloning**:
  - Copies a remote repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

- **Fetching**:
  - Retrieves commits, files, and refs from a remote repository but doesn't modify your working directory.

    ```bash
    git fetch
    ```

- **Pulling**:
  - Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into your current branch.

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

- **Pushing**:
  - Sends your local commits to the remote repository.

    ```bash
    git push
    ```

### **Resolving Merge Conflicts**

- **When Conflicts Occur**:
  - Conflicts happen when changes from different branches affect the same lines in a file or when a file is deleted in one branch but modified in another.

- **Steps to Resolve**:
  1. **Identify Conflicts**:
     - Git marks the conflicting areas in the files.
  2. **Edit Conflicting Files**:
     - Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
     - Decide which changes to keep or combine them.
  3. **Mark as Resolved**:
     - After editing, add the files to the staging area:

       ```bash
       git add <file>
       ```

  4. **Commit the Merge**:
     - Complete the merge with:

       ```bash
       git commit
       ```

- **Tools for Resolving Conflicts**:
  - **Command Line**: Use `git mergetool`.
  - **Graphical Tools**: KDiff3, Meld, Beyond Compare.
  - **IDE Integration**: Many IDEs provide visual merge conflict resolution.

## **Code Reviews and Pull Requests**

## **Advanced Git Techniques**

### **Stashing Changes**

- **Purpose**:
  - Temporarily save changes when you need to switch branches or pull updates without committing.

- **Commands**:
  - **Stash Changes**:

    ```bash
    git stash
    ```

  - **List Stashes**:

    ```bash
    git stash list
    ```

  - **Apply Stash**:

    ```bash
    git stash apply [stash@{index}]
    ```

  - **Apply and Remove Stash**:

    ```bash
    git stash pop
    ```

  - **Stash with Message**:

    ```bash
    git stash save "Your message"
    ```

### **Interactive Rebasing**

- **Purpose**:
  - Edit commit history by changing, combining, or deleting commits.

- **Usage**:

  ```bash
  git rebase -i HEAD~n
  ```

  - Replace `n` with the number of commits to look back.

- **Actions in Interactive Rebase**:
  - **pick**: Use commit as is.
  - **reword**: Use commit but edit the commit message.
  - **edit**: Pause to amend the commit.
  - **squash**: Combine commit with the previous one.
  - **fixup**: Like squash but discard the commit message.
  - **drop**: Remove commit.

### **Cherry-Picking Commits**

- **Purpose**:
  - Apply changes from a specific commit to your current branch.

- **Usage**:

  ```bash
  git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
  ```

- **Use Cases**:
  - Bring a bug fix from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

### **Git Hooks**

- **Definition**:
  - Scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow.

- **Types of Hooks**:
  - **Client-Side Hooks**:
    - Run on local operations like commits and merges.
    - Examples: `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-push`.
  - **Server-Side Hooks**:
    - Run on network operations like receiving pushed commits.
    - Examples: `pre-receive`, `update`, `post-receive`.

- **Usage**:
  - Enforce commit messages formats.
  - Run tests or linters before committing.
  - Prevent commits if certain conditions aren't met.

- **Setting Up Hooks**:
  - Located in the `.git/hooks` directory.
