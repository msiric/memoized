# **Cyclic Sort Technique**

The Cyclic Sort technique is a useful approach for solving problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range. This sorting technique efficiently places elements in their correct positions by swapping them with the elements at their target indices, ensuring that each number is placed at the index equal to its value.

## **Concept and Use Cases**

**Definition:** 
Cyclic Sort is a pattern that iterates through the array, and if the current number is not at its correct index, it swaps it with the number at its correct index. This process continues until all numbers are placed at their correct indices.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Sorting an array of unique numbers in the range from 1 to n.
- Finding missing numbers in an array.
- Finding duplicate numbers in an array.
- Finding the smallest missing positive number.

### **Visual Representation:**
Consider an array `[3, 1, 5, 4, 2]`. After applying Cyclic Sort, the array will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

## **When to Use**
- When the problem involves an array of numbers in a specific range (e.g., 1 to n).
- When you need an efficient way to sort the array or find missing/duplicate elements.

## **Time and Space Complexity**

**Time Complexity:** 
- O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. Each element is moved to its correct position in a single pass through the array.

**Space Complexity:**
- O(1), as the sorting is done in-place without using additional data structures.

## **Sorting an Array of Numbers from 1 to n**

**Problem:** Given an array of unique numbers from 1 to n, sort the array in-place.

### **Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Iterate through the array.
2. For each element, if it is not at its correct index, swap it with the element at its correct index.
3. Continue this process until all elements are in their correct positions.

### **Example:**

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
function cyclicSort(arr) {
    let i = 0;

    while (i < arr.length) {
        const correctIndex = arr[i] - 1;
        if (arr[i] !== arr[correctIndex]) {
            [arr[i], arr[correctIndex]] = [arr[correctIndex], arr[i]];  // Swap elements
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    return arr;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [3, 1, 5, 4, 2];
console.log(cyclicSort(arr));  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

```typescript
function cyclicSort(arr: number[]): number[] {
    let i = 0;

    while (i < arr.length) {
        const correctIndex = arr[i] - 1;
        if (arr[i] !== arr[correctIndex]) {
            [arr[i], arr[correctIndex]] = [arr[correctIndex], arr[i]];  // Swap elements
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    return arr;
}

// Example usage:
const arr: number[] = [3, 1, 5, 4, 2];
console.log(cyclicSort(arr));  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

</CodeGroup>

### **Tips and Tricks:**
- Ensure the correct index calculation is accurate to avoid infinite loops.
- Use a while loop instead of a for loop to handle swaps effectively without skipping elements.
- Use swapping to place elements in their correct positions efficiently.

### **Frequent Gotchas:**
- Handling duplicate elements incorrectly, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect sorting.
- Incorrectly calculating the correct index, resulting in misplaced elements.
- Ensuring the array contains all elements from 1 to n without any missing or extra elements.

## **Finding Missing Numbers**

**Problem:** Given an array containing numbers from 1 to n with some missing numbers, find all the missing numbers.

### **Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Use the Cyclic Sort technique to place all numbers at their correct indices.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and identify indices where the numbers are not correct.
3. The missing numbers correspond to the indices where the values are incorrect.

### **Example:**

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
function findMissingNumbers(arr) {
    let i = 0;

    while (i < arr.length) {
        const correctIndex = arr[i] - 1;
        if (arr[i] > 0 && arr[i] <= arr.length && arr[i] !== arr[correctIndex]) {
            [arr[i], arr[correctIndex]] = [arr[correctIndex], arr[i]];  // Swap elements
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    const missingNumbers = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] !== i + 1) {
            missingNumbers.push(i + 1);
        }
    }

    return missingNumbers;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [3, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5];
console.log(findMissingNumbers(arr));  // Output: [6]
```

```typescript
function findMissingNumbers(arr: number[]): number[] {
    let i = 0;

    while (i < arr.length) {
        const correctIndex = arr[i] - 1;
        if (arr[i] > 0 && arr[i] <= arr.length && arr[i] !== arr[correctIndex]) {
            [arr[i], arr[correctIndex]] = [arr[correctIndex], arr[i]];  // Swap elements
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    const missingNumbers: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] !== i + 1) {
            missingNumbers.push(i + 1);
        }
    }

    return missingNumbers;
}

// Example usage:
const arr: number[] = [3, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5];
console.log(findMissingNumbers(arr));  // Output: [6]
```

</CodeGroup>

### **Tips and Tricks:**
- Ensure the array contains numbers in the range from 1 to n with possible missing numbers.
- Use a while loop to handle swaps effectively without skipping elements.
- After sorting, iterate through the array to identify missing numbers based on incorrect positions.

### **Frequent Gotchas:**
- Handling numbers outside the range (e.g., negative numbers or numbers greater than n).
- Incorrectly identifying missing numbers due to misplaced elements.
- Ensuring the array contains valid elements before applying the Cyclic Sort technique.

## **Finding Duplicate Numbers**

**Problem:** Given an array containing numbers from 1 to n with some duplicates, find all the duplicate numbers.

### **Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Use the Cyclic Sort technique to place all numbers at their correct indices.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and identify indices where the numbers are not correct.
3. The duplicate numbers correspond to the values that are out of place.

### **Example:**

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
function findDuplicateNumbers(arr) {
    let i = 0;

    while (i < arr.length) {
        const correctIndex = arr[i] - 1;
        if (arr[i] !== arr[correctIndex]) {
            [arr[i], arr[correctIndex]] = [arr[correctIndex], arr[i]];  // Swap elements
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    const duplicates = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] !== i + 1) {
            duplicates.push(arr[i]);
        }
    }

    return duplicates;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2];
console.log(findDuplicateNumbers(arr));  // Output: [3]
```

```typescript
function findDuplicateNumbers(arr: number[]): number[] {
    let i = 0;

    while (i < arr.length) {
        const correctIndex = arr[i] - 1;
        if (arr[i] !== arr[correctIndex]) {
            [arr[i], arr[correctIndex]] = [arr[correctIndex], arr[i]];  // Swap elements
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    const duplicates: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] !== i + 1) {
            duplicates.push(arr[i]);
        }
    }

    return duplicates;
}

// Example usage:
const arr: number[] = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2];
console.log(findDuplicateNumbers(arr));  // Output: [3]
```

### **Tips and Tricks:**
- Ensure the array contains numbers in the range from 1 to n with possible duplicates.
