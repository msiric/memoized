# **Welcome to Memoized: Master Technical Interviews the JavaScript Way**

Welcome to the course! As the sole developer behind Memoized, I’ve poured my heart into creating a platform that truly helps JavaScript and TypeScript engineers like you master data structures and algorithms. I hope this course will help you gain the in-depth knowledge and practical skills you need to confidently ace your coding interviews.

## **Why Memoized?**

### **Personal Experience**
I created Memoized out of my own frustrations with existing resources that often dive straight into defining data structures and solving algorithmic questions without first ensuring we master the language of implementation. Most resources focus on Python, which forced me to rewrite all the solutions in JavaScript, slowing down my progress. Memoized is designed specifically for JavaScript and TypeScript engineers, ensuring you learn in the context of the language you'll use, making the material more relevant and easier to apply.

### **Comprehensive Curriculum**
The curriculum is meticulously structured to take you from the basics of JavaScript’s built-in data structures, through custom implementations, to advanced problem-solving techniques and sophisticated algorithms. Each section and lesson is crafted with depth and practical insights to ensure you not only understand the concepts but can apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.

### **Depth and Practical Insights**
Memoized goes beyond surface-level knowledge. Each lesson offers in-depth explanations and real-world applications to ensure a comprehensive understanding of each topic. You'll gain insights from practical tips and tricks, learn about common pitfalls, and understand the 'why' and 'when' of using specific algorithms and data structures.

### **Interview-Ready**
Memoized is designed to help you ace technical interviews with common techniques and strategies. You'll be prepared to tackle any challenge with confidence, supported by practice problems that reinforce your learning.

## **What You'll Learn**

1. **Built-In Data Structures**: Master the fundamental data structures in JavaScript, including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, sets, and maps. Learn their methods, use cases, and performance implications.

2. **User-Defined Data Structures**: Go beyond the basics with custom data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, heaps, trees, graphs, and tries. Understand their implementations, optimizations, and practical applications.

3. **Common Techniques**: Delve into widely-used algorithms and problem-solving techniques essential for coding interviews. Explore sliding windows, two pointers, cyclic sort, tree and graph traversals, binary search, and more.

4. **Advanced Topics**: Dive deep into complex subjects such as dynamic programming, segment trees, union find, minimum spanning trees, shortest path algorithms, and more. These topics will give you a competitive edge in technical interviews and real-world problem-solving.

## **Unique Features**

- **Hands-On Practice**: Each lesson includes practice problems directly linked to relevant LeetCode questions, allowing you to apply what you've learned immediately and track your progress. There are over 150 problem questions spanning various categories and difficulties under each lesson that the user can mark as complete or incomplete to help practice for their interviews and track their progress.
- **Progress Tracking**: Use the "Lesson completed?" prompts at the end of each lesson to keep track of your learning journey. Your progress is visually tracked, helping you see your achievements and identify areas for improvement.
- **Problems Page**: A dedicated [`/problems`](/problems) page lists all the questions in one place, allowing you to search, filter, and sort them according to your needs.
- **Free Access to Essential Lessons**: The first lesson of each section is free, allowing users to get a feel for the content before diving into the premium material.
- **Flexible Subscriptions**: Choose from monthly, yearly, or lifetime subscriptions to access the premium content. Flexible payment plans are offered to suit your needs and commitment levels.
