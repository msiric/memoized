## Welcome to Memoized

Welcome to Memoized, your ultimate resource for mastering data structures and algorithms in JavaScript and TypeScript! As a fellow software engineer, I created this platform to bridge the gaps I encountered while preparing for technical interviews. Here's what sets Memoized apart:

### Why Memoized?

**Personal Experience**: I found most existing resources lacking in a few critical areas. They often dove straight into defining data structures and solving algorithmic questions without first helping learners master the language in which these concepts would be implemented. This led to a significant learning curve and slowed my progress as I had to rewrite solutions in JavaScript from resources primarily written in Python.

**JavaScript Focus**: Unlike many other platforms, Memoized is designed specifically for JavaScript and TypeScript. JavaScript's unique built-in data structures and methods are powerful tools for solving interview questions, yet few resources adequately cover them. Memoized fills this gap by dedicating time to thoroughly exploring and mastering these built-in features before moving on to more complex, user-defined data structures.

### What You'll Learn

**Comprehensive Curriculum**: Our curriculum is structured to take you from the basics of JavaScript's built-in data structures, through custom implementations, to advanced problem-solving techniques and sophisticated algorithms. Each section and lesson is crafted with depth and practical insights to ensure you not only understand the concepts but can apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.

1. **Built-In Data Structures**: Master the fundamental data structures in JavaScript, including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, sets, and maps. Learn their methods, use cases, and performance implications.

2. **User-Defined Data Structures**: Go beyond the basics with custom data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, heaps, trees, graphs, and tries. Understand their implementations, optimizations, and practical applications.

3. **Common Techniques**: Delve into widely-used algorithms and problem-solving techniques essential for coding interviews. Explore sliding windows, two pointers, cyclic sort, tree and graph traversals, binary search, and more.

4. **Advanced Topics**: Dive deep into complex subjects such as dynamic programming, segment trees, union find, minimum spanning trees, shortest path algorithms, and more. These topics will give you a competitive edge in technical interviews and real-world problem-solving.

### Unique Features

- **Hands-On Practice**: Each lesson includes practice problems directly linked to relevant LeetCode questions, allowing you to apply what you've learned immediately and track your progress.
- **Progress Tracking**: Use our "Lesson completed?" prompts at the end of each lesson to keep track of your learning journey.
- **Free Access to Essential Lessons**: Every first lesson of each section is free for all users, ensuring everyone has access to the foundational knowledge before diving into premium content.
- **Flexible Subscriptions**: Choose from monthly, yearly, or lifetime subscriptions to access our premium content. We offer flexible payment plans to suit your needs and commitment levels.
