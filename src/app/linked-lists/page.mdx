# **JavaScript Linked Lists**

Linked Lists are a fundamental data structure used to store collections of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.

## **Concept and Use Cases**

**Definition:**
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element, known as a node, contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head, and the last node points to null, indicating the end of the list.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Implementing dynamic data structures like stacks and queues.
- Managing ordered collections that frequently change size.
- Efficient insertion and deletion of elements, especially in the middle of the list.
- Use in applications like graph adjacency lists and memory management.

## **Types of Linked Lists**
- **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
- **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the head, forming a circle.

## **When to Use**
- When you need a dynamic data structure with efficient insertions and deletions.
- When the order of elements matters but you don't need random access.
- When implementing other data structures like stacks and queues.

## **Time and Space Complexity**

**Time Complexity:**
- Access by index: O(n)
- Insertion/Deletion at the beginning: O(1)
- Insertion/Deletion at the end (singly linked): O(n)
- Insertion/Deletion at the end (doubly linked): O(1)
- Searching: O(n)

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

## **Linked List Operations and Methods**

### **Creating a Linked List**

**Example:**
```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
        this.size = 0;
    }

    // Methods to be defined...
}
```

### **Inserting Elements**

**At the Beginning:**
```javascript
class LinkedList {
    // ... other methods ...

    insertAtBeginning(value) {
        const newNode = new Node(value);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
        } else {
            newNode.next = this.head;
            this.head = newNode;
        }
        this.size++;
    }
}
```

**At the End:**
```javascript
class LinkedList {
    // ... other methods ...

    insertAtEnd(value) {
        const newNode = new Node(value);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
        } else {
            let current = this.head;
            while (current.next) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
        this.size++;
    }
}
```

### **Deleting Elements**

**From the Beginning:**
```javascript
class LinkedList {
    // ... other methods ...

    deleteFromBeginning() {
        if (!this.head) return null;
        const value = this.head.value;
        this.head = this.head.next;
        this.size--;
        return value;
    }
}
```

**From the End:**
```javascript
class LinkedList {
    // ... other methods ...

    deleteFromEnd() {
        if (!this.head) return null;
        if (!this.head.next) {
            const value = this.head.value;
            this.head = null;
            this.size--;
            return value;
        }
        let current = this.head;
        while (current.next.next) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        const value = current.next.value;
        current.next = null;
        this.size--;
        return value;
    }
}
```

### **Searching for Elements**

**By Value:**
```javascript
class LinkedList {
    // ... other methods ...

    search(value) {
        let current = this.head;
        while (current) {
            if (current.value === value) return true;
            current = current.next;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### **Traversing the List**

**Example:**
```javascript
class LinkedList {
    // ... other methods ...

    traverse() {
        let current = this.head;
        while (current) {
            console.log(current.value);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
}
```

## **Practical Tips and Tricks**

- **Use Sentinel Nodes:**
  Using a dummy head node can simplify insertions and deletions by avoiding special cases for an empty list or single element list.
  **Example:**
  ```javascript
  class LinkedList {
      constructor() {
          this.head = new Node(null);  // Dummy node
          this.size = 0;
      }

      insertAtEnd(value) {
          const newNode = new Node(value);
          let current = this.head;
          while (current.next) {
              current = current.next;
          }
          current.next = newNode;
          this.size++;
      }

      // Other methods...
  }
  ```

- **Reverse a Linked List:**
  Reversing a linked list is a common interview question.
  **Example:**
  ```javascript
  class LinkedList {
      // ... other methods ...

      reverse() {
          let prev = null;
          let current = this.head;
          while (current) {
              let next = current.next;
              current.next = prev;
              prev = current;
              current = next;
          }
          this.head = prev;
      }
  }
  ```

## **Common Gotchas**

- **Null Checks:**
  Always check for null when traversing or manipulating nodes to avoid runtime errors.
  **Example:**
  ```javascript
  let current = this.head;
  while (current && current.next) {
      // Perform operations
      current = current.next;
  }
  ```

- **Edge Cases:**
  Consider edge cases like empty lists, single element lists, and operations at the boundaries (beginning or end of the list).

- **Memory Leaks:**
  In languages with manual memory management, ensure that removed nodes are properly deallocated to avoid memory leaks. JavaScript manages memory automatically, but be cautious of references that might prevent garbage collection.

## **Advanced Topics**

### **Doubly Linked Lists**

Doubly linked lists have nodes that point to both the next and previous nodes, allowing for more efficient insertions and deletions from both ends.

**Example:**
```javascript
class DoublyNode {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
        this.prev = null;
    }
}

class DoublyLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
        this.size = 0;
    }

    insertAtEnd(value) {
        const newNode = new DoublyNode(value);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
            this.tail = newNode;
        } else {
            this.tail.next = newNode;
            newNode.prev = this.tail;
            this.tail = newNode;
        }
        this.size++;
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

### **Circular Linked Lists**

Circular linked lists have the last node pointing back to the head, forming a circle. They are useful in scenarios where the list needs to be traversed repeatedly.

**Example:**
```javascript
class CircularLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
        this.size = 0;
    }

    insertAtEnd(value) {
        const newNode = new Node(value);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
            newNode.next = this.head;
        } else {
            let current = this.head;
            while (current.next !== this.head) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
            newNode.next = this.head;
        }
        this.size++;
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

## **Linked List Algorithms**

### **Detecting a Cycle**

**Example:**
```javascript
class LinkedList {
    // ... other methods ...

    hasCycle() {
        let slow = this.head;
        let fast = this.head;
        while (fast && fast.next) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow === fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### **Merging Two Sorted Lists**

**Example:**
```javascript
function mergeTwoSortedLists(l1, l2) {
    let dummy = new Node(0);
    let current = dummy;

    while (l1 && l2) {
        if (l1.value < l2.value) {
            current.next = l1;
            l1 = l1.next;
        } else {
            current.next = l2;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    current.next = l1 || l2;
    return dummy.next;
}
```
