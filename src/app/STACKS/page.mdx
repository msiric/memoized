{/* Comprehensive Guide to Stacks in JavaScript
1. Introduction to Stacks
A stack is a simple yet powerful linear data structure that operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates; you can only take the top plate off or add a new plate to the top.

Real-World Analogy:
Just like a stack of books where you can only add or remove the book on the top, a stack data structure allows you to add or remove data elements only from one end, known as the "top" of the stack.
2. Basic Operations
Stacks primarily support four fundamental operations, each playing a crucial role in its utility and efficiency:

Push:
This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.
javascript
Copy code
// Push operation example
function push(element, stack) {
  stack.push(element);
}
Pop:
This operation removes the top element from the stack and returns it, reducing the size of the stack by one.
javascript
Copy code
// Pop operation example
function pop(stack) {
  if (stack.length === 0) {
    return 'Underflow'; // Attempting to pop from an empty stack
  }
  return stack.pop();
}
Peek:
Peek allows you to look at the top element of the stack without removing it.
javascript
Copy code
// Peek operation example
function peek(stack) {
  return stack[stack.length - 1];
}
isEmpty:
This method checks whether the stack is empty.
javascript
Copy code
// Check if stack is empty
function isEmpty(stack) {
  return stack.length === 0;
}
3. Implementing a Stack in JavaScript
While JavaScript's array methods naturally support stack operations, understanding how to implement a stack from scratch can deepen your grasp of this structure.

Using Array:
JavaScript arrays come with built-in methods that make implementing a stack straightforward.
javascript
Copy code
let stack = [];
stack.push(1); // Adding an element to the top of the stack
console.log(stack.pop()); // Removing and returning the top element of the stack
Creating a Stack Class:
For educational purposes or to encapsulate stack behavior, you can create a class that defines a stack with its operations.
javascript
Copy code
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return "Underflow"; // Prevent popping from an empty stack
    }
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
}

4. Use Cases and Applications
Stacks are versatile and used in various applications across computer science and software development:

Undo Mechanisms:
Stacks are ideal for implementing undo mechanisms in software applications. Each action is pushed onto a stack, and undoing an action simply involves popping the last action off the stack and reversing it.
javascript
Copy code
let history = new Stack();
history.push('write code');
history.push('save file');
history.push('commit changes');

function undo(lastAction) {
  console.log(`Undoing ${lastAction}`);
}

// Undo the last action
undo(history.pop());  // Outputs: "Undoing commit changes"
Function Call Stack:
The call stack in programming languages is a stack that keeps track of function calls. This helps with function invocation management, particularly with recursive functions and returning values after function execution.
javascript
Copy code
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  else return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

factorial(3); // Call stack helps manage these recursive calls
Expression Evaluation and Syntax Parsing:
Stacks are used in compilers and interpreters for evaluating expressions and parsing program syntax, especially in converting expressions in infix notation to postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) or for parsing balanced parentheses and brackets.
javascript
Copy code
function evaluate(expression) {
  let stack = new Stack();
  expression.split('').forEach(char => {
    if (char === '(') {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === ')') {
      if (stack.peek() === '(') stack.pop();
    }
  });
  return stack.isEmpty();
}

evaluate('(5 + 6) * (7 + 8)/(4 + 3)'); // Uses stack to ensure parentheses are balanced
5. Common Interview Questions
Stacks are a popular topic in technical interviews. Here are some typical problems:

Balanced Parentheses:
Checking for balanced parentheses is a classic problem that can be solved efficiently using a stack.
javascript
Copy code
function isBalanced(expression) {
  let stack = new Stack();
  for (let char of expression) {
    if (char === '(') stack.push(char);
    else if (char === ')') {
      if (stack.isEmpty()) return false;
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.isEmpty();
}
Stock Span Problem:
Calculate the span of stock’s price for all days, where span is the number of consecutive days before the current day where the stock price was less than or equal to the price at current day.
javascript
Copy code
function calculateSpan(prices) {
  let spans = new Array(prices.length).fill(1);
  let stack = new Stack();

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    while (!stack.isEmpty() && prices[stack.peek()] <= prices[i]) {
      stack.pop();
    }
    spans[i] = stack.isEmpty() ? i + 1 : i - stack.peek();
    stack.push(i);
  }
  return spans;
}
Next Greater Element:
Identify the next greater element for each element in an array using a stack for a more efficient solution.
javascript
Copy code
function nextGreaterElement(array) {
  let result = new Array(array.length).fill(-1);
  let stack = new Stack();

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    while (!stack.isEmpty() && array[stack.peek()] < array[i]) {
      result[stack.pop()] = array[i];
    }
    stack.push(i);
  }
  return result;
}
6. Advanced Stack Problems
Exploring more complex problems helps solidify your understanding and handling of stack operations:

Implementing Stacks with Queues:
Challenge yourself to implement a stack using two queues. The trick is to make either push or pop operation costly by managing the order of elements in queues.
Min Stack Design:
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time using an auxiliary stack to keep track of the minimum elements.

7. Exercises and Challenges
Practicing with exercises is essential to mastering stack operations and their applications. Here are some hands-on coding activities and suggestions for online challenges:

Coding Exercises:
Implement a Stack: Create a stack from scratch using arrays or linked lists and implement basic operations like push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

8. Review Sessions and Interactive Learning
Interactive sessions are invaluable for reinforcing concepts and clarifying doubts. Here are some strategies to enhance learning through interaction:

Q&A Sessions:
Regular Q&A sessions help address specific questions and clear up misunderstandings related to stack operations and their uses. These sessions can be conducted in classroom settings, webinars, or online forums.
