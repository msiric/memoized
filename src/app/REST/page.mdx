{/* 1. BigInt
   Description: The bigint type extends the number type to represent integers of arbitrary length. It's useful when dealing with very large integers that exceed the safe integer limit for Numbers.
   Creation: You can create a bigint by appending n to the end of an integer literal or by calling the BigInt() function.
   javascript
   Copy code
   let largeNumber = 9007199254740991n;
   let sameLargeNumber = BigInt("9007199254740991");
   Use Cases: bigint is particularly useful in financial calculations that involve large numbers, cryptography, and anywhere you need more than 53 bits of precision.
   Interview Focus: Be prepared to discuss scenarios where floating-point precision errors occur with Number and how bigint can solve them.
2. Boolean
   Description: The boolean type has two values: true and false. It's often the result of comparisons and conditions.
   Creation: Booleans can be explicitly set or derived from Boolean operations.
   javascript
   Copy code
   let isAvailable = true;
   let isGreater = 4 > 3; // results in true
   Use Cases: Booleans are foundational in control flow statements like if, while, and for making decisions in code logic.
   Interview Focus: Know how to manipulate and use boolean values in logic-based questions, including understanding truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
3. Symbol
   Description: Introduced in ES6, symbols are unique and immutable primitive values that can be used as identifiers for object properties.
   Creation: Each time you call Symbol(), it generates a new, unique symbol. Optionally, you can provide a description.
   javascript
   Copy code
   let sym1 = Symbol("identifier");
   let sym2 = Symbol("identifier");
   console.log(sym1 === sym2); // false
   Use Cases: Symbols are used to create private or hidden object properties and methods, which is useful in avoiding property name collisions between multiple libraries and modules.
   Interview Focus: While symbols are less common in interviews, understanding their unique properties can be useful in questions involving object property encapsulation or meta-programming.
4. Undefined and Null
   Undefined:
   Description: undefined is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not yet assigned a value.
   Creation: Variables become undefined by default, or you can explicitly set them.
   javascript
   Copy code
   let a;
   console.log(a); // undefined
   Use Cases: Commonly seen in function parameters that have not been supplied, or missing properties of an object.
   Interview Focus: Key to understanding JavaScript’s variable initialization and function behavior.
   Null:
   Description: null is an assignment value that represents a deliberate non-value. It is explicitly nothing.
   Creation: You can assign null to a variable to denote that it intentionally has no value.
   javascript
   Copy code
   let result = null;
   Use Cases: Often used to initialize a variable that may later be assigned a more specific value.
   Interview Focus: Important for demonstrating an understanding of intentional versus unintentional absence of value.
   Interview Preparation Tips
   Understanding Differences: Be clear on the differences between null and undefined, and when each is appropriate to use.
   Practical Applications: Know practical applications of each type, especially bigint and symbol, which might appear in more advanced or specialized coding problems.
   Truthy vs Falsy: Be prepared to discuss and work with JavaScript's truthy and falsy values, crucial for control flow and logical operations. */}
