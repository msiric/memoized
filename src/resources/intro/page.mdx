**_Please note:_**  Some of these resources are paid services or products. I am not affiliated with or sponsored by any of these resources. This list is based solely on my personal experience and research.

### **How to Approach These Resources**

Although this list of resources might seem intimidating, please understand that I don't recommend you go through all the links from start to finish. You know yourself best and can probably already identify areas that need improving and can focus on relevant resources from this list. I did the same when preparing for my interviews. You'll learn to:

- Spend more time on specific content that addresses your weak areas
- Spend less time on content that might not be as beneficial to you
- Use this list as a source of options to keep you motivated to improve as an engineer

Remember, the goal is not to exhaust every resource, but to strategically use them to enhance your skills and knowledge in the areas most relevant to your goals and current skill level.
This addition provides excellent guidance and helps manage expectations for anyone looking at this comprehensive list. It emphasizes the importance of personalized learning and strategic resource utilization, which are crucial for effective interview preparation and overall professional development.
